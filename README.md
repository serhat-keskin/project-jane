## 📖 Overview

**Project Jane** is a polished 2D puzzle-platformer developed in just **72 hours** for a game jam. It challenges players to navigate a treacherous industrial facility where survival depends on a unique strategic alliance: learning to manipulate the very machines sent to stop you.

Built with **Unity**, this project showcases how a tight deadline can foster innovation in core mechanics and atmospheric storytelling. Originally conceived as "Linda," the codebase has since been modernized for a global audience.

## 🎮 Core Mechanics

### 🤖 Friend or Foe System
Not every enemy must be destroyed—some can be repurposed.
- **Hostile State:** By default, security robots will hunt you down. One touch is fatal.
- **Ally State:** Deprive a robot of its energy source, and its programming resets. It becomes a loyal companion, following you through the facility.
- **Kamikaze Tactics:** Use your new allies strategically. A "tamed" robot will sacrifice itself to destroy other hostile units blocking your path.

### ⚙️ Environmental Hazards
The facility is alive with traps designed to halt your progress:
- **Laser Barriers:** High-energy beams that require creative solutions to bypass.
- **Industrial Chainsaws:** deadly obstacles that demand precise platforming.
- **Dynamic Platforms:** Moving surfaces that test your timing and agility.
